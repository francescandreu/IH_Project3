# Finding best office location

## Project Description
The goal for this project is to find the best possible location for a Tech Company Office around the world. To find it, we query a MongoDB Database with the companies information. Given vairous conditions that define if a location is atractive, I evaluated which conditions are more important and which location is most desirable.
